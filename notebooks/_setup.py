"""Path bootstrap for lab notebooks.

Resolves the repo root (where `app/`, `scripts/`, `data/` live) regardless of
where Jupyter was launched from. Used by all 4 notebooks:

    import _setup  # noqa: F401   -- adds repo root to sys.path

Why: `sys.path.insert(0, "../scripts")` is cwd-relative and silently breaks
when the notebook runs from CI or a different working directory. `__file__`
is stable; cwd is not.
